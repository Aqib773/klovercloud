It's not a one-sized solution to implement a microservice architecture. Every monolith has its strong and long-lasting benefits that work better for many cases, despite its being less and less common. There is no need for microservices with a small engineering team that aims at designing a simple and lightweight framework. This would promote the construction, making improvements, implementation, and testing of a monolithic application.
In dynamic and emerging systems, microservices architecture is more desirable. In one application, it provides efficient methods for the handling of a dynamic structure of multiple functions and facilities.
